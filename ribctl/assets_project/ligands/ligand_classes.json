According to their basic skeleton, quassinoids are categorized into five distinct groups, C-18, C-19, C-20, C-22 and C-25 types. The C-20 quassinoids can be further classified into two types, tetracyclic and the pentacyclic. The tetracyclic variety does not have oxygenation at C-20, while the pentacyclic quassinoids possess additional oxygenation at C-20 that allows for the formation of an additional ring.",

These are sesquiterpene mycotoxins structurally characterized by the presence of an epoxide ring and a benzopyran derivative with a variant number of hydroxyl, acetyl, or other substituents. The most important structural features causing the biological activities of trichothecenes are the 12,13-epoxy ring, the presence of hydroxyl or acetyl groups at appropriate positions on the trichothecene nucleus and the structure and position of the side-chain.",
