According to their basic skeleton, quassinoids are categorized into five distinct groups, C-18, C-19, C-20, C-22 and C-25 types. The C-20 quassinoids can be further classified into two types, tetracyclic and the pentacyclic. The tetracyclic variety does not have oxygenation at C-20, while the pentacyclic quassinoids possess additional oxygenation at C-20 that allows for the formation of an additional ring.",

The C-20 quassinoids can be further classified into two types, tetracyclic and the pentacyclic. The tetracyclic variety does not have oxygenation at C-20, while the pentacyclic quassinoids possess additional oxygenation at C-20 that allows for the formation of an additional ring.",
