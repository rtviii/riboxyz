# WTH is:

- plasmid
- pseudouridinylations
- methylation
- CP central proturberance
- chaperones and their mediation of rna folding
- does "co-transcriptional" mean "simultaneously with transcription"?

- how's transcription elongation different from translation-elongation?


- is the nomenclature for domains and helices fully specified? 

    Switch 1 domain doesn't have a single specific nucleotide sequence, its location is determined by its structural characteristics and interactions within the ribosome.
