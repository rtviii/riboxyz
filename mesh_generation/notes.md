# Defining the EXIT

# In eukarya:

5.8S rRNA seems to be involved in the constriction site, actually

The following protein are in the immediate proximity of the tunnel:

uL4, uL22, 
eL32, eL37, eL39
uL24

of which uL4, uL22, eL32, uL24 form a "crown" around the exit site


# In Bacteria:

uL4, uL22, uL23, uL24
