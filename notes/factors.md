# Elongation

Xu et Al. 2022 Elongation Factors Review

### GTP Hydrolysis

- how the fuck does gtp hydrolysis take place biochemically?
- how does the energy get imparted to the P-site trna to move it ahead?
- WTH "Brownian Ratchet"??

    EF-G integrates the energy regimes of a motor protein and a GTPase,
    and promotes tRNA motion through the combined use of power stroke and Brownian ratchet mechanisms
