# Elongation

Xu et Al. 2022 Elongation Factors Review

### GTP Hydrolysis

- how the fuck does gtp hydrolysis take place biochemically?
- how does the energy get imparted to the P-site trna to move it ahead?
- WTH "Brownian Ratchet"??

    EF-G integrates the energy regimes of a motor protein and a GTPase,
    and promotes tRNA motion through the combined use of power stroke and Brownian ratchet mechanisms



## Open Problems

The physiological significance of phosphorylated EF-G still needs to be elucidated.
The molecular mechanism of how ADP-ribosylation impairs the function of eEF2 has not been fully elucidated
EF4 may contribute to the cell survival under adverse conditions, but the physiological 


# Assembly actors
role of the protein remains unclear.

- rrnTAC

# WTH is:

- plasmid
- pseudouridinylations
- methylation
- CP central proturberance
- chaperones and their mediation of rna folding
- does "co-transcriptional" mean "simultaneously with transcription"?

- how's transcription elongation different from translation-elongation?


- is the nomenclature for domains and helices fully specified? 

    Switch 1 domain doesn't have a single specific nucleotide sequence, its location is determined by its structural characteristics and interactions within the ribosome.
