For each established polymer nomenclature class (i.e. uL2/23SrRNA/eF-Tu/eIF-5/etc) an HMM exists(it's constructed on the fly from ~10 phylogenetically closest sequences). When a new sequence is received (at ETL time), it is compared against every HMM. The HMM with the highest score (lowest e-value) && above a given threshold is selected as the corresponding class.
