#### On identifying subdomains, helices, functional sites etc.

the idea with fleshing out this somewhat loose datastructure is not to make it persistent through unknown amount of bells and whistles and constant maintenance, but to have it be a scaffold on which an nlp agent can walk and throguh which the literature can be connected to the coordinates. humbly building the bridge for the blind prophet to wander.
