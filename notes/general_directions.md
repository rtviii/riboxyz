Biogenesis and assembly being the endgame, i think it makes sense to start at the elongation stage and work our way "outwards" in both directions given the following:

1. How much more ample the data and research there is
2. Elongation and initiation factors are relatively few compared to assembly & biogenesis

                    Biogenesis <|| Assembly <|| Initiation + Elongation + Translocation ||> Termination ||> Release ||> Recycling ||> Assembly

- Would like to review the rRNA sequences and see what riboxyz is missing 
- Are any domains and helices mentioned in the literature specified enough to identify them programmatically?
