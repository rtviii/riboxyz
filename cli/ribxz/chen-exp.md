Now, will an HPC system admin role, on both hardware and software, match your interest?  

Could you tell me a bit more about your experience on HPC configuration, bioinformatics database design and EM data processing tools?

-----------------


## HPC configuration:

Have:

- lots of experience with hpc job and software configs as a user of ubc sockeye for myself, on behalf of the members of the lab, collaborators from other labs (evo bio). 

- good understanding of unix and flavors, software installation and configuration, parallelization facilities (threads, processes, cores) and monitoring.

Have not:

- never set up a private network/dhcp from scratch (would be in fact delighted to figure out)

## Bioinformatics database design:

Have:

- for the ribosome use case i have experience designing one bottom-up: schema, format, tools involved, interfaces to the adjacent applications.

- containerization and deployment of software

- lots of exposure to cloud processes, general grasp of economics involved 

- some experience with system design: both niche (riboxyz) and high-thoroughput (fintech).

Have not:

- not a huge deal of multiseq alignment experience and the algos they use.


## EM data processing tools:

Regarding EM processing: directly i only worked with em-maps in a numerical context on an optimal transport paper with khanh and others, so where experiments are concerned i have only second-hand notions of the reconstruction processes like relion. Obviously something i would be extremely happy to brush up on -- just haven't had the chance so far. I did set up cryosparc on Khanh's personal machine once.
