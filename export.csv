The default policy is the 'periodic' check-point policy, as specified by the 'db.checkpoint.interval.tx' and 'db.checkpoint.interval.time' settings. The Neo4j Enterprise Edition provides two alternative policies: The first is the 'continuous' check-point policy, which will ignore those settings and run the check-point process all the time. The second is the 'volumetric' check-point policy, which makes a best-effort at check-pointing often enough so that the database doesn't get too far behind on deleting old transaction logs in accordance with the 'db.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy' setting."""

This setting is advisory, is ignored in Neo4j Community Edition, and is followed to best effort in Enterprise Edition. An IO is in this case a 8 KiB (mostly sequential) write. Limiting the write IO in this way will leave more bandwidth in the IO subsystem to service random-read IOs, which is important for the response time of queries when the database cannot fit entirely in memory. The only drawback of this setting is that longer checkpoint times may lead to slightly longer recovery times in case of a database or system crash. A lower number means lower IO pressure, and consequently longer checkpoint times. Set this to -1 to disable the IOPS limit and remove the limitation entirely; this will let the checkpointer flush data as fast as the hardware will go. Removing the setting, or commenting it out, will set the default value of 600."""

This does not guarantee that members of this group will be leader at all times, but the cluster will attempt to transfer leadership to such a member when possible.

Either `high_limit` or `block` is required if you have a graph that is larger than 34 billion nodes, 34 billion relationships, or 68 billion properties."""

Every additional 4 CPUs add another 512KB into the buffer size. The maximal buffer size in this default scheme is 4MB taking into account that there can be one transaction log writer per database in a multi-database env.For example, runtimes with 4 CPUs will have a buffer size of 1MB; runtimes with 8 CPUs will have buffer size of 1.5MB; runtimes with 12 CPUs will have buffer size of 2MB."""

Set this to `true` in situations where it is preferable to have any queries using the 'shortestPath' function terminate as soon as possible with no answer, rather than potentially running for a long time attempting to find an answer (even if there is no path to be found). For most queries, the 'shortestPath' algorithm will return the correct answer very quickly. However there are some cases where it is possible that the fast bidirectional breadth-first search algorithm will find no results even if they exist. This can happen when the predicates in the `WHERE` clause applied to 'shortestPath' cannot be applied to each step of the traversal, and can only be applied to the entire path. When the query planner detects these special cases, it will plan to perform an exhaustive depth-first search if the fast algorithm finds no paths. However, the exhaustive search may be orders of magnitude slower than the fast algorithm. If it is critical that queries terminate as soon as possible, it is recommended that this option be set to `true`, which means that Neo4j will never consider using the exhaustive search for shortestPath queries. However, please note that if no paths are found, an error will be thrown at run time, which will need to be handled by the application."""

The default value of `true` will instead throw an exception.

After this time, the graph statistics will be evaluated, and if they have changed by more than the value set by dbms.cypher.statistics_divergence_threshold, the query will be replanned. If the statistics have not changed sufficiently, the same interval will need to pass before the statistics will be evaluated again. Each time they are evaluated, the divergence threshold will be reduced slightly until it reaches 10% after 7h, so that even moderately changing databases will see query replanning after a sufficiently long time interval."""

A value of `0` means that the query will be replanned as soon as there is any change in statistics and the replan interval has elapsed.

After this interval, the divergence threshold will slowly start to decline, reaching 10% after about 7h. This will ensure that long running databases will still get query replanning on even modest changes, while not replanning frequently unless the changes are very large."""

If a seed source (URI scheme) is supported by multiple providers in the list, the first matching provider will be used.

Caching is used to limit the number of LDAP requests that have to be made over the network for users that have already been authenticated successfully. A user can be authenticated against an existing cache entry (instead of via an LDAP server) as long as it is alive (see `dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl`).

This hashing is done using a cryptographic hash function together with a random salt. Preferably a conscious decision should be made if this method is considered acceptable by the security standards of the organization in which this Neo4j instance is deployed."""

If set to `true` then instead of using attributes on the user object to determine group membership (as specified by `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes`), the `user` object will only be used to determine the user's Distinguished Name, which will subsequently be used with  `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter` in order to perform a nested group search. The Distinguished Names of the resultant group search results will be used to determine roles."""

The mapped roles will be cached for the duration of `dbms.security.auth_cache_ttl`, and then expire, requiring re-authentication. To avoid frequently having to re-authenticate sessions you may want to set a relatively long auth cache expiration time together with this option. NOTE: This option will only work if the users are permitted to search for their own group membership attributes in the directory.

You need to specify the username and password using the settings `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_username` and `dbms.security.ldap.authorization.system_password` with this option. Note that this account only needs read access to the relevant parts of the LDAP directory and does not need to have access rights to Neo4j, or any other systems."""

With this option turned on, databases will share cache space, but not cache entries. This means that a database may store and retrieve entries from the shared cache, but it may not retrieve entries produced by another database. The database may, however, evict entries from other databases as necessary, according to the constrained cache size and cache eviction policy. In essence, databases may compete for cache space, but may not observe each others entries.

This setting is only valid for REST, and does not influence bolt-server. It sets the amount of worker threads for the Jetty server used by neo4j-server. This option can be tuned when you plan to execute multiple, concurrent REST requests, with the aim of getting more throughput from the database. By default, it is set to the number of available processors, or to 500 for machines with more than 500 processors. Your OS might enforce a lower limit than the maximum value specified here."""
