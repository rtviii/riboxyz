        "In the E. coli cytosol, a fraction of the newly synthesised proteins requires the activity of molecular chaperones for folding to the native state. The major chaperones implicated in this folding process are the ribosome-associated Trigger Factor (TF), and the DnaK and GroEL chaperones with their respective co-chaperones. Trigger Factor is an ATP-independent chaperone and displays chaperone and peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activities in vitro. It is composed of at least three domains, an N-terminal domain which mediates association with the large ribosomal subunit, a central substrate binding and PPIase domain with homology to FKBP proteins, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. The positioning of TF at the peptide exit channel, together with its ability to interact with nascent chains as short as 57 residues renders TF a prime candidate for being the first chaperone that binds to the nascent polypeptide chains [1]. This family represents the N-terminal region of the protein."

        "In the E. coli cytosol, a fraction of the newly synthesised proteins requires the activity of molecular chaperones for folding to the native state. The major chaperones implicated in this folding process are the ribosome-associated Trigger Factor (TF), and the DnaK and GroEL chaperones with their respective co-chaperones. Trigger Factor is an ATP-independent chaperone and displays chaperone and peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activities in vitro. It is composed of at least three domains, an N-terminal domain which mediates association with the large ribosomal subunit, a central substrate binding and PPIase domain with homology to FKBP proteins, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function. The positioning of TF at the peptide exit channel, together with its ability to interact with nascent chains as short as 57 residues renders TF a prime candidate for being the first chaperone that binds to the nascent polypeptide chains [1]. This family represents the N-terminal region of the protein."

It is composed of three domains, an N-terminal domain which mediates association with the large ribosomal subunit (ribosome-binding domain, RBD), a central PPIase domain with homology to FKBP proteins, and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) which forms the central body of the protein and has two helical arms that create a cavity [1,2]. The association between its N-terminal domain with the ribosomal protein L23 located next to the peptide tunnel exit is essential for the interaction with nascent polypeptides and its in vivo function [1]. This entry represents the C-terminal region of TF which has a multi-helical structure consisting of an irregular array of long and short helices structurally similar to the peptide-binding domain of the bacterial porin chaperone SurA [3]."
