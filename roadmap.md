# Features to stability:

- api
- url fixes

# DevOps:

- one-click docker deployment 
- how can we benefit from github actions?

# Later:

- "last updated" section
- automatic update per struct -- cron job every 24 weeks

- [x] rewrite struct init scripts in python
- [x] rewrtie cli in python
- [ ] graph.ribosome.xyz
- monitoring

# LIGANDS

- ligands/ligandlike should have a common category in the db. filter the ions too. some ligands are not redndered at all (ex. 5AFI.FME)

- gene ontology + bird + CCD

## Branching out to other resources
- interpro

## Static Files Server

- [ ] Doc for generating the species list and how to enrich the interface with them

- [ ] a page with all the structures | nomenclatures generated 
(as a response/as a page)

- [ ] API page
- [ ] download functionalities for csvs
- [ ] actual static files for chains, rnas
- [ ] track parameter passing to visualization
- [ ] certain structs don't load


options undefined  when returning from a protclass link to a ligand prediction.

# General


- [ ] Clean up the unused files and npm installs

- [ ] Parameter-passing everywhere
- [ ] 3d align page downloads workable
- [ ] certain structs (?7k8f) don't load
- [ ] regenerate taxonomy
- [ ] create a browsable catalogue for RCSB to plug into
- [ ] species-search bugs (abstract the tax-tree component out)


# RNA Page

- [ ] Downloads as csvs
- [ ] Wrong router parametrs crash the show


# Structure Page

- [ ] Layout, alphabetical protein/rna layout

# Binding Sites

- [ ] Generating .csv's for export 
	- [ ] binding site
	- [ ] prediction
