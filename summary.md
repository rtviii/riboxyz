# "Expanding" the nomenclature

This nomenclature crusade should, ideally, driven by a concrete application, but it would be nice to at least have an account of useful/desirable categories and progress on each in one place. This exists in the form of a [ google sheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mapshbn1ArofPN-Omu8GG5QdcwlJ0ym0BlN252kkUBU/edit?usp=sharing) at the moment. 

Obvious, but better stated explicitly: 

The general utility of having these categories concretized and equipped with an unequivocal identification criterion is being able to parse them out from any structure with all the usual benefits of having a heterogeneity dataset like that.

Some general issues with methodically parsing members of these categories are:
1. a lot of the criteria identifying them seem purely experimental and would be ad-hoc if translated directly into code.
2. the more granular categories just dissolve into bleeding edge of science and are still in flux
 
With that said, there is definitely a subset of thes categories/types that has both scientific consensus and identifiable features. Basically, I see a balancing act between recruiting as many easily-identifiable types to the structural profile of the ribosome as opposed to gettig caught up in categorizing something ephemeral. The moment discrete categories start to fail and probably a few moments before that -- it's time to take look at shapes and density maps. I think this holds for both macro and micro features (ex. whole-struct assembly stages vs rProtein domain motions during elongation).

1 assembly
2 init, elongation, term into database
3 different stages of translation (tak to Aryan)
4 add emdb
5 get embd maps (all, but start with ecoli)
